            ProB2-UI (JavaFX)
=======================================

We are happy to announce version 1.1.0 of the new JavaFX-based UI of the animator and model checker ProB.
This user interface is available for download at:
    https://www3.hhu.de/stups/prob/index.php/Download#ProB2_UI_using_Java_FX
As of version 1.1.0, we provide native installers for the following platforms:
 - Windows (tested on Windows 10 20H2)
 - macOS (notarized for macOS 10.15 and 11, but also works on older versions),
 - Debian-based Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, etc.).
 
These installers include a Java runtime, so they do not require Java to be installed first.
We also offer a traditional executable jar file that can be run on any system with Java 8 or later installed.


Compared to ProB Tcl/Tk this UI has the following new features:
 - visualisation of models using the SVG-based plugin VisB
 - project management, i.e., a set of specifications can be grouped in a project,
   where you can also store machine specific preferences and verification tasks
 - saving multiple traces and replay them individually or batched
 - the ability to store various verification tasks (model checking, LTL model checking,
   symbolic model checking, trace replay, ...) and re-check them
 - directly load Rodin models from Rodin workspaces (without having to export them within Rodin)
 - an integrated view for all dot-based graph visualisations
   (state space, machine hierarchy, formulas, projection diagrams, enabling graphs, 
   event refinement hierarchy, ...)
 - an integrated view to access all table based statistics
   (event coverage, MC/DC coverage, read-write matrices, WD POs, ...)
 - symbolic MC/DC test case generation
 - a multi-language interface, currently providing English, French, German and Russian
 
 Version 1.1.0:
 - now contains VisB directly in the application, VisB has been extended considerably
   now supporting hovers, more attributes, better debugging and error feedback, ...
 - supports model checking with time and state limit
 - improved feedback for model checking (progress bar, memory usage)
 - improved feedback for trace replay
 - supports well-definedness checking (as an option under symbolic model checking)
 - improved test case generation view with ability to save generated traces
 - supports static analysis on machine
 - supports exporting graphs from graph visualization view as .dot, .png, and .pdf
 - added table visualization options for jumping to state IDs and source code locations
 - improved state view that supports expanding formulas
 - improved error feedback in the animator, especially when the machine could not be initialized
 - improved highlighting of errors in editor
 - added option to control warning detail level - can disable warnings or enable additional messages
 - contains Prolog Output Console for debugging
 - supports syntax highlighting for TLA, CSP, Alloy, XTL, and Z
 - fixed Z support on macOS and Linux
 - improved performance in various places, especially on startup, when switching machines, and when large machines are loaded
