            ProB JavaFX UI
=======================================

We are happy to announce version 1.1.0 of the new JavaFX-based UI of the animator and model checker ProB.
This UI is available for download at (along with a notarized version for macOS):
    https://www3.hhu.de/stups/prob/index.php/Download#ProB2_UI_using_Java_FX


Compared to ProB Tcl/Tk this UI has the following new features:
 - visualsation of models using the SVG-based plugin VisB
 - project management, i.e., a set of specifications can be grouped in a project,
   where you can also store machine specific preferences and verification tasks
 - can save multiple traces and replay them individually or batched
 - the ability to store various verification tasks (model checking, LTL model checking,
   symbolic model checking, trace replay, ...) and re-check them
 - apply model checking with time and state limit
 - directly load Rodin models from Rodin workspaces (without having to export them within Rodin)
 - an integrated view for all dot-based graph visualisations
   (state space, machine hierarchy, formulas, projection diagrams, ...)
 - an integrated view to access all table based statistics (MC/DC coverage,...)
 - MC/DC test case generation
 
 Version 1.1.0:
 - now contains VisB directly in the application, VisB has been extended considerably
   now supporting hovers, more attributes, better debugging and error feedback, ...
 - supports model checking with time and state limit
 - improved feedback for model checking (progress bar, memory usage)
 - improved feedback for trace replay
 - supports well-definedness checking (as symbolic model checking)
 - improved test case generation view with ability to save generated traces
 - supports static analysis on machine
 - supports exporting Dot View as .dot, .png, and .pdf
 - contains Prolog Output Console for debugging
 - supports syntax highlighting for TLA, CSP, Alloy, XTL, and Z
