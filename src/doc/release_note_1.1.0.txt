            ProB JavaFX UI
=======================================

We are happy to announce version 1.1.0 of the new JavaFX-based UI of the animator and model checker ProB.
This UI is available for download at (along with a notarized version for macOS):
    https://www3.hhu.de/stups/prob/index.php/Download#ProB2_UI_using_Java_FX


Compared to ProB Tcl/Tk this UI can:
 - directly load Rodin models from Rodin workspaces (without having to export them within Rodin)
 - visualize models using the SVG-based plugin VisB
 - has project management features, i.e., a set of specifications can be grouped in a project,
   where you can also store machine specific preferences and verification tasks
 - save multiple traces and replay them individually or batched
 - the ability to store various verification tasks (model checking, LTL model checking,
   symbolic model checking, trace replay, ...)
 - MC/DC test case generation
 
 Version 1.1.0:
 - now contains VisB directly in the application, VisB has been extended considerably
   now supporting hovers, more attributes, better debugging and error feedback, ...
 -

Best regards,
The ProB team
