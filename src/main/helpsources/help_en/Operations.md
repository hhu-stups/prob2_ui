![Operations](../screenshots/Operations.png)

The Operations View shows the operations on a machine, if a machine is loaded. If you click on an operation shown in the list, it will be executed if possible. 

The text box on the top of this view provides filtering of operations and the questionmark button leads to this article providing help on the Operations View. The chevron buttons and the circular button on the left provide the same functionality like those of the [History View](History.md), namely moving back and forth in history and reloading a machine. The four buttons on the right side below the help button have following purposes: The leftmost button allows you to sort the operations, the eye button toggles visibility of unusable operations, the entwined arrows button executes a certain amount of random operations and the stop button cancels the currently executed operation.
