This tab shows the current and previous state of the machine. It will update every time an operation is executed (or you go back in [the history](../History.md)).
This tab also provides a console for additional information and operations.
By using the searchbox on top of the tab you can filter for certain tags (e.g. operations, constants).
The button right next to it shows or hides the fulltext of the formulas in the "properties"-area.
You can sort the elements in alphabetical order by clicking on the headlines of the columns.
