The VisB Plugin provides an interactive Visualisation of the current machine. To use this plugin, two files are needed, the VisB-file in .json-format and a svg-file.
You can find further information on how to create those files in the user manual.

As soon as the machine is open an initialised, the VisB-window shows a graphic visualisation of the machine, which can be animated by clicking on the visualisation itself.
Possible operations and transitions are additionally shown the operations- and history-view.

The buttons in the top left corner allow you to
* open or close files and save the current visualisation
* reload or close the current visualisation
* zoom in or out
* show current items and events
* set default visualisations
* open the user manual or this help page


The buttons in the top right corner allow you to open selected traces for replay, open [SimB](../Main%20Menu/Advanced/SimB.md) and save current traces or states as html-file or the generated visualisation as png-file.

Similar to the history- or operations-view, you can use the button on the bottom of the view to navigate through the executed transitions.
