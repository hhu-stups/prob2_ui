![DotView](../../screenshots/Visualisations/DotView.png)

This view provides the opportunity to show various visualisations about the loaded machine such as the state space or the machine hierarchy and save them as images.

In the bottom left view a short description of the visualisation is displayed. 

Settings that are relevant for the certain visualisation can be customized via "Edit preferences".

Some visualisations expect a formula which is then shown in the corresponding context.

The visualisation can be zoomed in or out via the buttons in the upper right corner or in the menu "View".
