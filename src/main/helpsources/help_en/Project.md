If no machine or no project has been opened, the Project View will allow you to create a project. 
If you choose to open a machine without having a project, a default project will be created.

The Project View contains four tabs:
* [Machines](#Machines), containing a list of machines added to this project
* [Status](#Verifications), containing the verification status of each machine
* [Preferences](#Preferences), containing custom preferences
* [Project](#Project), shows an overview of the current project

## <a id="Machines"> Machines Tab </a>

![Machines Tab](../screenshots/Project/Machines%20Tab.png)

This Tab shows the machines, that currently belong to the project.
You can create new machines or add existing ones using the plus-button.
The order of the machines in the project can be changed with the arrow-buttons.
A small green circle next to the machine indicates, that this machine is currently loaded. Right-Clicking on one of the machines
opens the context-menu, offering several methods to edit machines, start animations (with customized preferences, if those are added), or remove machines from the list.

## <a id="Verifications"> Status Tab </a>

![Status Tab](../screenshots/Project/Verifications%20Tab.png)

This tab shows the status of each type of verification run on the machines contained by the project. 
If no test of a specific verification type has been run, a <span style="color:darkgrey">grey</span> circle is shown. 
If the verification type could not recognize any failures, a <span style="color:green">green</span> checkmark will be displayed. 
If a test failed, a <span style="color:red">red</span> X  will be shown.

## <a id="Preferences"> Preferences Tab </a>

![Preferences Tab](../screenshots/Project/Preferences%20Tab.png)

This tab allows to add, edit and remove preference settings.
When adding a preference using the plus-button, a window opens, where you're allowed to choose a name for the preference and 
different options for customized settings.
Each preference will be shown in a list in the tab and can be removed or edited by right-clicking on a specific preference.

## <a id="Project"> Project Tab </a>

This tab shows the name and the description of the current project. 
Both are either automatically generated by opening a machine or chosen by the user who manually created the project and can be changed by double clicking on each respectively.
