The History View shows a list of already executed operations.
The view ist linked to the operation- and visualisation-options and the [state-view](Main%20View/State%20View.md) of ProB.
So when executing a transition via [VisB](Main%20Menu/Visualisations/VisB.md) or the [operations-view](Operations.md) for example, it will be added to the history automatically. 
When going back in history by clicking on one of the listed transitions or via the arrow-buttons, the possible operations in the operations-view, 
the state of the machine in the stateview and the visualisations change.

The arrow in the top left corner of the view allows you to go back and forth in the history. The circular arrow reloads the machine.
Attention! When reloading the machine or going back in the history and then executing an operation, the previous history will be overwritten/deleted!

With the buttons in the top right corner you can save executed traces (as .csv-file oder a .prob2trace) and load traces for replay.
