![History View](../screenshots/History.png)

The History View shows a list of already executed operations. The items contained in this list are linked to the State View: When selecting one of these items, State View shows the current and the previous state of the chosen machine.  The chrevron buttons on the left allow to go back and forth in history by one step. If you push the circular button the machine will be reloaded and the previous history will be lost if you did not save the trace. The two buttons on the right provide saving a trace and help.

Note that if you choose to go back in history and execute an operation the previously following one will be lost.
