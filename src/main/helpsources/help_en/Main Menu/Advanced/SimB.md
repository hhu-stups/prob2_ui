SimB allows you to create and execute interactive and automated animations of a machine, considering timing aspects.
Therefore, a SimB-file in .json-format must be provided.
Examples can be found at https://github.com/favu100/SimB-examples

As soon as a SimB-file ist loaded, the machine can be animated and the resulting trace can be saved, including its timing properties.

Via the plus-button, different kinds of simulations can be added, 
to validate probabilistic and timing properties of the machine:
* Monte-Carlo-simulation
* Hypothesis-test and
* Estimation

Further explanation on how to create SimB-files as well as information about the different kinds of simulations can be found [here](https://prob.hhu.de/w/index.php?title=SimB).
