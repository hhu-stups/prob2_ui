This view provides the opportunity to show various visualisations about the loaded machine such as the state space or the machine hierarchy as a graph or table and export them.

In the bottom left view a short description of the visualisation is displayed.
Settings that are relevant for the certain visualisation can be customized via "Edit preferences".
Some visualisations expect a formula which is then shown in the corresponding context.
Graph visualisations can be zoomed in or out via the buttons in the upper right corner or in the menu "View".
