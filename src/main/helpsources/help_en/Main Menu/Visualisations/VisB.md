The VisB Plugin provides an interactive Visualisation of the current machine. To use this plugin, two files are needed, the VisB-file in .json-format and a svg-file.
You can find further information on how to create those files in the user manual.

As soon as the machine is open an initialised, the VisB-window shows a graphic visualisation of the machine, which can be animated by clicking on the visualisation itself.
The bar on the bottom of the window shows the current state of the visualisation, e.g. transitions that couldn't be executed or machine updates.
Possible operations and transitions are additionally shown the operations- and history-view.

The menu bar on top of the window allows you to
* open or close files and save the current visualisation as image ("File")
* reload or close the current visualisation ("Edit")
* in- or decrease the font size or zoom in or out ("View")
* open the user manual or this help page ("Help")

The buttons in the top left corner provide fast access to the functionalities named above.
Furthermore, the i-Button shows current items and events. Via the cogwheel-Button, default visualisations can be set and added.

Similar to the history- or operations-view, you can use the button in the middle to navigate through the executed transitions.

The buttons in the top right corner allow you to open selected traces for replay, open [SimB]() and save current traces or states as html-file.


Some examples for visualisation with VisB can be found [here](https://gitlab.cs.uni-duesseldorf.de/general/stups/visb-visualisation-examples).
